Add a resmio button or widget to your website.

== Description ==
resmio provides you with an online reservation system software for your restaurant that allows you to manage all reservations received in your restaurant quickly and easily. In order to recieve reservations from your website you have to integrate the codesnippet provided by resmio either for the widget itself or for a reservation button (which then loads the widget).
With this plugin you do not have to manually add these codesnippets to your site. Instead you can type shortcodes directly into the wysiwyg-editor and or insert the shortcodes through a menu button in the toolbar of the TinyMCE editor (only in visual mode).
The shortcodes are:
[resmio-button] -> for the resmio button
[resmio-widget] -> for the resmio widget 

= Why Use It? =
Instead of adding whole codesnippets for your resmio button/widget to your website you can use shortcodes.

= How To Use (once plugin is installed) =
1) Go to settings -> resmio button and widget and insert your resmio ID
   1.1) If you want to alter the colors of the button (and so on) activate extended settings
2) Save the settings
3) Go to your page/post and insert the shortcode you want to use.
   There are two ways to insert the shortcodes:
   3.1) Type the shortcodes '[resmio-button]' and/or '[resmio-widget]' directly into the wysiwyg editor
   3.2) Use the menu button 'resmio' in the toolbar of your wysiwyg-editor (only in visual mode)
